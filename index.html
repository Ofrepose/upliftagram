        <h2 class="articleTitle">A Visual Communication Map for Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning<h2 class="articleAuthor">Ngoc Duy Nguyen, Thanh Thi Nguyen, Saeid Nahavandi</h2></h2>

        <p class="articleBlurb">Multi-agent learning distinctly poses significant challenges in the effort to allocate a concealed communication medium. Agents receive thorough knowledge from the medium to determine subsequent actions in a distributed nature. Apparently, the goal is to leverage the cooperation of multiple agents to achieve a designated objective efficiently. Recent studies typically combine a specialized neural network with reinforcement learning to enable communication between agents. This approach, however, limits the number of agents or necessitates the homogeneity of the system. In this paper, we have proposed a more scalable approach that not only deals with a great number of agents but also enables collaboration between dissimilar functional agents and compatibly combined with any deep reinforcement learning methods. Specifically, we create a global communication map to represent the status of each agent in the system visually. The visual map and the environmental state are fed to a shared-parameter network to train multiple agents concurrently. Finally, we select the Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithm to demonstrate our proposed scheme, namely Visual communication map for Multi-agent A3C (VMA3C). Simulation results show that the use of visual communication map improves the performance of A3C regarding learning speed, reward achievement, and robustness in multi-agent problems.</p>

        <p class="articleBlurb">Many vector-borne disease epidemic models neglect the fact that in modern human civilization, social awareness as well as self-defence system are overwhelming against advanced propagation of the disease. News are becoming more effortlessly accessible through social media and mobile apps, while apparatuses for disease prevention are inclined to be more abundant and affordable. Here we study a simple host-vector model in which media-triggered social awareness and seasonality in vector breeding are taken into account. There appears a certain threshold indicating the alarming outbreak; the number of infective human individuals above which shall actuate the self-defence system for the susceptible subpopulation. A model where the infection rate revolves in the likelihood of poverty, reluctancy, tiresomeness, perceiving the disease as being easily curable, absence of medical access, and overwhelming hungrier vectors is proposed. Further discoveries are made from undertaking disparate time scales between human and vector population dynamics. The resulting slow-fast system discloses notable dynamics in which solution trajectories confine to the slow manifold and critical manifold, before finally ending up at equilibria. How coinciding the slow manifold with the critical manifold enhances periodic forcing is also studied. The finding on hysteresis loops gives insights of how defining alarming outbreak critically perturbs the basic reproductive number, which later helps keep the incidence cycle on small magnitudes.</p>

        <p class="articleBlurb">The realization of integrated quantum circuits requires precise on-chip control of charge carriers. Aiming at the coherent coupling of distant nanostructures at zero magnetic field, here we study the ballistic electron transport through two quantum point contacts (QPCs) in series in a three terminal connfguration. We enhance the coupling between the QPCs by electrostatic focusing using a field effect lens. To study the emission and collection properties of QPCs in detail we combine the electrostatic focusing with magnetic de ection. Comparing our measurements with quantum mechanical and classical calculations we demonstrate how the coherent and ballistic dynamics depend on the details of the QPC confinement potentials.</p>
